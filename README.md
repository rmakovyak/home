# Tenant registration app

## Getting Started

### Installing

Install npm dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run dev server. Opens on port 3000

```
npm run start
```

## Running the tests

Unit test are covering only critical parts
To run tests:
```
npm run test
```

### And coding style tests

I am using default create react linter here. 


## Built With

* [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Validate.js](https://validatejs.org/) 

I have not used any UI framework or any other libs as I don't see much need in them for this task.

## Acknowledgments

* I took Home styles from main website as inspiration
* Due to it's simplicity application has only mobile and desktop version
* Styles are written in rather direct approach and can be further improved
* Registration form can be split in more components to keep it maitanable
